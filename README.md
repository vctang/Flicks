Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. How to better implement the search function (i.e. searching by genre or ratings)
2. How to implement a filter (audience age ratings, genre, showing on a certain day/time)
